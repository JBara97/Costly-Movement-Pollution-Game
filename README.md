# Costly-Movement-Pollution-Game

Code, generated data and figures associated with the "The impact of mobility costs on cooperation and welfare in spatial social dilemmas" manuscript, preprint available on Research Square [https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3694286/v1]. In particular this uses the costly movement model for the pollution game; for the distance-limited model and code see https://github.com/JBara97/Pollution-Game.

pollution.py is the module to import in, for practical running of code see the Jupyter notebooks.

Requirements for scripts: Python 3.0
