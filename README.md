Code, generated data and figures associated with the "The impact of mobility costs on cooperation and welfare in spatial social dilemmas" manuscript. In particular this uses the costly movement model for the pollution game; for the distance-limited model and code see https://github.com/JBara97/Pollution-Game.

pollution.py is the module to import in, for practical running of code see the Jupyter notebooks.

Requirements for scripts: Python 3.0
