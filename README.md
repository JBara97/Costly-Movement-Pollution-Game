Code, generated data and figures associated with the Mobility, Imitation and Clustering Enable Cooperation in Spatial Social Dilemmas manuscript. In particular this uses the costly movement model for the pollution game; for the distance-limited model and code see https://github.com/JBara97/Pollution-Game.

pollution.py is the module to import in, for practical running of code see the Jupyter notebooks.

Requirements for scripts: Python 3.0
